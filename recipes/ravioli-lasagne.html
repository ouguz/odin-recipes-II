    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cook this lasagne for the family on a busy weeknight. It only takes 15 minutes to prepare and uses just five ingredients, including shop-bought ravioli</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>oil, for frying</li>
        <li>6 sausages (we used Italian sausages with herbs and fennel)</li>
        <li>2 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes with garlic & basil</li>
        <li>200g baby spinach</li>
        <li>500g spinach & ricotta ravioli (or any flavour you like)</li>
        <li>75g mixture of grated cheddar and mozzarella</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan. Squeeze the sausagemeat from the skins and fry until browned, using a wooden spoon to break it up. Add the tomatoes and half a can of water and season. Simmer for 20 mins.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, put the spinach in a colander. Pour over boiled water from the kettle to wilt. Leave to cool, then squeeze out as much of the excess water as you can.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Spoon a third of the sauce into a medium baking dish (about 18 x 20cm). Top with a third of the spinach and a third of the ravioli, then scatter over some of the cheese. Repeat the layers twice, making sure the final layer of ravioli is nestled into the sauce. Bake for 35-40 mins until bubbling and hot all the way through. Cover if the top starts to get too dark. Will keep in the freezer for up to two months.</li>
    </ol>
