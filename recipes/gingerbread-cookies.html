        <li>170g soft light brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ tsp fine sea salt</li>
        <li>1 medium egg</li>
        <li>200g plain flour</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Beat together the butter, treacle, brown sugar and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add the egg, then beat through all of the remaining dry ingredients apart from the caster sugar. Chill the mixture in the fridge for 1 hr.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 4. Line two baking sheets with baking parchment. Roll the mixture into 20 even-sized balls (weighing for accuracy, if you like).
